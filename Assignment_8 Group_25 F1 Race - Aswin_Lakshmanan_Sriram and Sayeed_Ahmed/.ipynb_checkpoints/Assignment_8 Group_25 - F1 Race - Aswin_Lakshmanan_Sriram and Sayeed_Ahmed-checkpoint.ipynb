    "Will [Max Verstappen](https://www.formula1.com/en/drivers/max-verstappen.html) rocks! win it all again in 2024? The first three F1 races are **Bahrain**, **Saudi Arabia**, and **Australia**! The 2023 driver standings are given [here](https://www.formula1.com/en/results.html/2023/drivers.html). \n",

What is the Probability Distribution for each F1 driver to win *both* the Bahrain and the Saudi Arabian Grand Prix? What is the Probability Distribution for each F1 driver to win the Bahrain, the Saudi Arabian, *and* the Australian Grand Prix? What is the probability for Red Bull to win all three races? What is the probability for Red Bull to win at least one race, at least two races, and at most two races? Note that Red Bull and all other racing teams have two drivers per race.\n",

    "## Question 3 (40 points)\n",
    "Red Bull wins one of these three races on a rainy day. What is the probability Red Bull wins all three, assuming races can be held on either rainy, sunny, cloudy, snowy or foggy days? Assume that rain, sun, clouds, snow, and fog are the only possible weather conditions on race tracks and there is an equal probability for each one of these weather events.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 4 (20 points) Is it the car, or is it the driver?\n",
    "Lewis will  be joining Ferrari, and that is the *big* unknown for the '24 season. What is in your opinion the best way to predict how Lewis + Ferrari will fair, based on the the [2023 standings](https://www.formula1.com/en/results.html/2023/drivers.html), and any other statistics you can gather from that Web site?\n",
    "\n",
    "You need to provide *proof* for your answers by using code, in the form of a function. `I think it's one in a million because Ferrari sucks` is not a good answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "Even though standings are bound to change with the results of the first races, please assume that the standinds that you will use to predict results will *not change* and will be based on the results of the '23 season.\n",
